    "As a data scientist, you will often have possession of a dataset that you know almost nothing about. The features could have cryptic names like “MetricCode” or “CategoryLabel,” and you will need to figure out what is happening with each feature. You might find something wrong with the data values. For example, the data could show some people having negative ages (minus 10 years old) or show children being older than their parents. There might be missing values or duplicated rows. \n",

    "This week, you will work with a dataset about bank customers. You will analyze and summarize the data to identify any problems with the data, and you will fix the problems. You will also learn how to use Google, documentation, and ChatGPT to develop programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "At the end of this week, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the importance of using data (data storytelling) in making information accessible to a wider audience\n",
    "- Extract important data/dataset from an unconventional format (pivot table, etc.)\n",
    "- Apply descriptive statistics to real-world data/datasets\n",
    "- Identify data quality issues of a given dataset \n",
    "- Explain how data quality issues impact the effective use/display of the data\n",
    "- Describe effective (good) and ineffective (bad) graphs\n",
    "- Create data visualizations using Matplotlib\n",
    "- Reproduce a graph/data visualization from an example graph/data visualization\n",
    "- Analyze existing data visualizations to identify strengths and weaknesses \n",
    "- Apply principles from Storytelling with Data (SWD) to create graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "- **Inconsistent data:** data that don’t make sense in some way, such as a person who is supposed to be twenty feet tall or one thousand years old\n",
    "- **Duplicate rows:** two rows that contain exactly the same data\n",
    "- **Imputing a value:** inserting a value into a dataset where one is missing"

    "\n",
    "#### Inconsistent Data\n",
    "Inconsistent data is data that is inconsistent, conflicted, or incompatible within a dataset or across many datasets. Data inconsistencies can occur for a variety of reasons, including mistakes in data entry, data processing, or data integration. These discrepancies might show as disagreements in data element values, formats, or interpretations. Inconsistent data can lead to faulty analysis, untrustworthy outcomes, and data management challenges.\n",

    "3. Detecting and Handling Outliers\n",
    "    - Outlier Detection: Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority of data points. Common methods include the IQR method and the Z-score method.\n",
    "    - Handling Outliers: Outliers can be addressed by removing them, transforming the data, or using robust statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "4. Standardizing Data Formats\n",
    "    - Data format consistency is essential, especially for date, time, and categorical variables. Use functions like as.Date() or as.factor() to standardize formats. Date variables should adhere to a consistent format to ensure accurate analysis and visualization.\n",
    "5. Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "    - Duplicate rows can distory analysis results. Ensure that you undestand the criteriea for identifying duplicates, as it may depend on specific columns. "
